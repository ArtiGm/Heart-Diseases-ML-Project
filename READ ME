# Predicting heart disease using machine learning

We are goping to take the following approach: 
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modeling
6. Experimentation

## 1. Problem definition

In a statement, 
. Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether a patient is going to 


## 1.2 What data are we using?

The original data came from the Cleveland database from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Howevever, we've downloaded it in a formatted way from Kaggle.

The original database contains 76 attributes, but here only 14 attributes will be used. Attributes (also called features) are the variables what we'll use to predict our target variable.

Attributes and features are also referred to as independent variables and a target variable can be referred to as a dependent variable.

    Note: We use the independent variable(s)to predict our dependent variable(s).

In our case, the independent variables are a patient's different medical attributes and the dependent variable is whether or not they have heart disease.


## 1.3 How will we evaluate our model?

An evaluation metric is something you usually define at the start of a project.

However, since machine learning is very experimental, it can change over time.

If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursure this project.


## 1.4 Which features of the data will be important to us?

Features are different parts and characteristics of the data. At the end we will also identify our most important features in our data

**Heart Disease Data Dictionary**

The following are the features we'll use to predict our target variable (heart disease or no heart disease).
Feature 	Description 	Example Values
1. age 	Age in years 	29, 45, 60
2. sex 	1 = male; 0 = female 	0, 1
3. cp 	Chest pain type
   * 0: Typical angina (chest pain),
   * 1: Atypical angina (chest pain not related to heart),
   * 2: Non-anginal pain (typically esophageal spasms (non heart related),
   * 3: Asymptomatic (chest pain not showing signs of disease)
4. trestbps 	Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) 	120, 140, 150
5. chol 	Serum cholesterol in mg/dl 	180, 220, 250
6. fbs 	Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) 	0, 1
7. restecg 	Resting electrocardiographic results 	0: Nothing to note, 1: ST-T Wave abnormality, 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy
8. thalach 	Maximum heart rate achieved 	160, 180, 190
9. exang 	Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) 	0, 1
10. oldpeak 	ST depression (heart potentially not getting enough oxygen) induced by exercise relative to rest 	0.5, 1.0, 2.0
11. slope 	The slope of the peak exercise ST segment 	0: Upsloping, 1: Flatsloping, 2: Downsloping
12. ca 	Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy 	0, 1, 2, 3
13. thal 	Thalium stress result 	1: Normal, 3: Normal, 6: Fixed defect, 7: Reversible defect
14. target 	Have disease or not (1 = yes; 0 = no) 	0, 1

    Note: No personal identifiable information (PPI) can be found in the dataset.
